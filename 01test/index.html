    <h1>Digital Citizenship</h1>
    <h2>What is Digital Citizenship?</h2>
    <p>Digital citizenship is the ability to participate in society by using technology safely, responsibly, and ethically. While it's often simplified as "internet safety," it is actually a much broader concept that covers how you represent yourself, how you treat others, and how you manage your own well-being in a digital world.</p>

    <h2>What is Digital Law?</h2>
    <p>Digital Law is the legal and ethical framework that governs how we behave online. It represents the "electronic responsibility" for your actions and deeds in the digital world.</p>

    <h2>What is AUP?</h2>
    <p>AUP stands for Acceptable Use Policy. It is a written agreement—essentially a "digital code of conduct"—that outlines the rules and guidelines for using a specific network, device, or service. You most commonly see these in schools, workplaces, and when signing up for internet service providers</p>

    <h2>What is Plagiarism?</h2>
    <p>Plagiarism is the act of taking someone else's work, ideas, or words and passing them off as your own. While people often think of it as just "copying a paper," in the digital age, it includes everything from "copy-pasting" a Wikipedia paragraph to using an image in a presentation without credit. It is a major breach of Digital Law and Digital Etiquette.</p>

    <h2>What is Academic Dishonesty?</h2>
    <p>Academic Dishonesty is a broad "umbrella term" that refers to any type of cheating or deceitful behavior in an educational setting. While we previously discussed plagiarism as a specific type of dishonesty (stealing ideas/words), academic dishonesty includes many other ways a student might try to gain an unfair advantage.</p>
    <p>Essentially, it is a violation of Academic Integrity—the commitment to being honest, fair, and responsible in your studies.</p>


    <h2>What are the rules for AI Generated Content?</h2>
    <p>n 2026, the rules for AI-generated content focus on transparency, accountability, and safety, shifting from optional suggestions to legal requirements like the EU AI Act and various state laws (e.g., California's AI Transparency Act and the Texas RAIGA). These rules mandate that any synthetic media—including images, video, and audio—be clearly labeled with visible watermarks and "latent" digital metadata so users can distinguish between human and machine-made work. In professional and academic settings, the "human-in-the-loop" principle is now standard, meaning you are legally and ethically responsible for verifying the accuracy of AI outputs and must disclose when AI was used as a significant contributor. Furthermore, new regulations strictly prohibit the use of AI for deceptive deepfakes or harmful manipulation, while intellectual property laws generally hold that content generated entirely by AI without substantial human creative input cannot be copyrighted.</p>
