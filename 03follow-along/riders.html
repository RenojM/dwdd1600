        <h1>About The Rider</h1>
        <h2>Motorcycle Sterotypes</h2>
        <p>What you ride says about you.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Yamaha Riders</dt>
            <dd>This group is a mixed bag of ego and expertise. Most Yamaha sport bike riders (if they aren't on a newer
                R1) are convinced they're the fastest thing on the road—even if it's mostly in their head—and there's a
                90% chance they're "car guys" when they aren't on two wheels. If you see a 2006-2008 R6, it's likely
                being used as a prop by an Instagram model for glamour shots and page views rather than actual canyon
                carving. However, the 2015+ R1 rider is the exception; they're usually a middle-aged track junkie who
                knows exactly what the hell they're doing and doesn't care that the front end looks a little bizarre.
            </dd>
            <dt>Honda CBR Riders</dt>
            <dd>This group is usually defined by either practicality or parents with deep pockets. The CBF600 and
                CBR650f riders are those who want to carve canyons and commute on a sport bike, but they're often
                battling lower back problems. Then you have the CBR300 and CBR500 crowd, who mainly bought the bike
                because Honda makes great cars and they simply walked away with whatever the floor salesman sold them.
                Finally, the CBR600rr is the classic choice for the 17 year old rich kid whose parents had to convince
                the sales rep he could handle a 600 as a first bike just because he rode dirt bikes as a kid.</dd>
            <dt>Kawasaki Riders</dt>
            <dd>The Green Team usually falls into two camps: the aspiring motovlogger or the high-interest adventurer.
                Many Ninja riders started because of a YouTube recommendation; they'll often claim they've "outgrown"
                the bike in under a year, despite having wide, dry chicken strips on their tires that say otherwise.
                You'll also find the ZX series crowd, frequently purchased with an enlistment bonus at a 16% APR. From
                the ZX14 riders to the Ninja 650 owners who wish they'd bought an SV650 instead, this group is the
                unofficial patron saint of the "spray-paint cosmetic overhaul.</dd>
            <dt>Harley-Davidson Riders</dt>
            <dd>Post-2004 Model Riders: This is often the 48-year-old accountant who is desperately trying to recapture
                his masculinity. You'll find him on the weekends "chasing the spirit of the road" as a way to escape the
                office and feel like an outlaw for a few hours.Pre-2004 Model Riders: This group tends to be a bit
                grittier. You're either looking at a hipster who loves the vintage aesthetic or a sketchy guy who has
                probably seen some things he shouldn't have. This is the rider who likely encourages his 52-year-old
                girlfriend to enter wet t-shirt contests at the local biker bar just for the hell of it.</dd>

        <h2>Rider Mindset</h2>
        <h3>The Flow State</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Riding serves as a form of moving meditation that anchors the mind in the present moment, allowing daily
                stresses and anxieties to fade away.</li>
            <li>It induces a "flow state" where the rider is completely immersed in the activity, resulting in peak
                performance and a sense of time standing stil</li>
            <li>Navigating challenging conditions builds a unique self-reliance and confidence that empowers riders to
                tackle other life challenges with a positive attitude.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Calculated Risk and Laser Focus</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The psychological thrill of motorcycling is rooted in a balance between unparalleled freedom and an
                acute perception of risk.</li>
            <li>Skilled riders maintain a laser-like focus to constantly assess their environment, making split-second
                decisions that ensure personal agency.</li>
            <li>Maintaining this mindset requires a commitment to safety, including wearing the right gear and
                continuously honing technical skills to protect the community.</li>
        </ul>
