        <p>The start of <strong>2026</strong> has brought major shifts for both pro riders and the social media
            community. In the racing
            world, all eyes are on the MotoGP 2026 season, which marks the return of the sport to Brazil after 22 years
            and the debut of the highly anticipated Yamaha V4 engine. Pro-level tech is also hitting the streets, with
            Indian Motorcycle celebrating its 125th anniversary by launching the 2026 Chief Vintage, featuring upgraded.
            Ride Command software that syncs mobile phones directly to the bike's dashboard.On social media, the
            conversation is dominated by Everyday Protection. Influencers and riders are moving away from bulky racing
            leathers in favor of CE-rated armored hoodies, reinforced riding jeans that look like normal denim, and
            lightweight urban gear. There is also a huge <strong>buzz</strong> around the newest electric motorcycles,
            specifically
            the Stark Varg EX, as riders share videos of its performance in dual sport environments.</p>

        <h2>Why We Ride</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The first is that on my bike is the only place I feel truly free. <em>Flying through the air, with no
                    sound</em>
                except the bike and the wind, I can temporarily run away from the stress and troubles of life. All the
                drama and personal and professional worries I have disappear. My only focus is on the road ahead (and
                not dying)</li>
            <li>The practicality is amazing! Living in place where traffic is horriable you can either take the bus with
                a moderately high chance of random homeless encounter for 40 minutes both ways + having to walk half a
                mile of it or a 10 minute commute (thank you lane splitting) on a motorcycle and park right outside
                right next to the place.</li>
            <li>We like riding for the escape from our phones and the sensation of freedom together.</li>
            <li>It's the closest you can get to flying without a pilot's license (so says my Dad, a former Cobra pilot).
            </li>
        </ol>
